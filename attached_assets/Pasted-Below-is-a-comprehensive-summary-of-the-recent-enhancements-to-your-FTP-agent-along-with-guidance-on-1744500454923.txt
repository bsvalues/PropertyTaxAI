Below is a comprehensive summary of the recent enhancements to your FTP agent along with guidance on next steps to ensure everything is working as intended.

## Summary of Changes

Your modifications to the FTP agent have achieved several key improvements:

- **Enhanced FTP Sync Scheduling**  
  - **One-time Sync Option:** The agent now supports a one-time manual sync alongside the scheduled intervals. This flexibility ensures that urgent data imports are possible without waiting for the next cycle.
  - **Overlap Prevention:** With a more advanced interval handling approach in place, your scheduling logic now actively checks for and prevents overlapping synchronization jobs. This avoids potential conflicts or data corruption when a sync job is still in progress.
  
- **Advanced Interval Handling**  
  - The new implementation calculates sync intervals more precisely. The agent now accounts for the runtime of the current job and adjusts the schedule accordingly to prevent collisions.
  
- **Improved Schedule Timing Calculation**  
  - Your `getNextSyncTime()` method has been enhanced to provide more accurate future sync time estimates. This helps in both tracking the synchronization schedule and debugging if necessary.
  
- **Human-readable Sync Schedule Information**  
  - A new method now generates a friendly string that displays the remaining time until the next scheduled sync. This is useful for status reporting and providing better transparency to users.
  
- **Enhanced FTP Status Reporting**  
  - The `getFtpStatus()` method now incorporates:
    - Connection details
    - Schedule information with human-readable timing
    - Additional statistics regarding recent sync activities  
  This comprehensive status update helps users (and you) to quickly verify that the agent is operating as expected.

## Next Steps

1. **Code Review and Testing**  
   - **Local Testing:** Run your FTP agent locally or in your development environment to ensure the new scheduling logic works without conflicts. Simulate scenarios with overlapping job triggers to verify the overlap prevention.
   - **Unit & Integration Tests:**  
     - Write tests that cover:
       - The calculation logic within `getNextSyncTime()`
       - The one-time sync execution pathway
       - That overlapping jobs are correctly detected and blocked
     - Validate the human-readable output to ensure it represents the correct sync timing.

2. **Deployment**  
   - Once youâ€™re satisfied with the tests, redeploy your application. Confirm that the deployment process properly applies the new changes. Users should see the updated FTP status, including the new scheduling information.
   - Consider setting up monitoring/logging for the FTP agent to track its performance in real time once deployed.

3. **User Feedback**  
   - Encourage users to report back on the FTP synchronization behavior. Their feedback might reveal edge cases or improvements that could be further refined.

4. **Documentation Update**  
   - Update your project documentation (e.g., README, inline code comments) to reflect the new features. Include details on:
     - How the scheduling interval is calculated
     - How the one-time sync feature is triggered
     - How overlapping sync jobs are prevented

5. **Future Enhancements Consideration**  
   - As mentioned earlier, while focusing on the FTP sync agent now, remember to plan for the Supabase integration later. A unified backend for both FTP and API status updates could further streamline your application.
