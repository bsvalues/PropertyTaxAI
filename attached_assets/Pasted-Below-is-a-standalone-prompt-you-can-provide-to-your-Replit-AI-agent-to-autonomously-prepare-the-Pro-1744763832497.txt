**Autonomous Replit AI Agent Instructions: 24-Hour PropertyTaxAI Demo Preparation**

*Project Context and Goal:*  
Prepare PropertyTaxAI—a smart property tax assessment tool developed for the Benton County Assessor’s Office—for an impressive live demo within 24 hours. Optimize and polish the application’s AI-driven tax calculation engine, user interface, and presentation materials so that the demo clearly highlights its accuracy, speed, and overall value in automating property tax assessments.

**IMPORTANT:** Use ONLY the property tax data already available in our files/attached_assets. Do not fetch external data unless something specific is missing. Work exclusively with authentic Benton County, Washington tax assessment data and established calculation standards.

**Structured Plan:**

1. **DEMO ENVIRONMENT SETUP (3 hours)**
   - **Data Preparation:**  
     - Utilize the existing property tax and related financial data from the files/attached_assets.
     - Select 10 representative properties covering different tax classifications:
       - 3 residential properties
       - 3 commercial properties
       - 2 industrial properties (or other specialized property types)
       - 2 mixed-use/special-purpose properties
   - **User Setup:**  
     - Create 3 demo user accounts (e.g., Admin, Tax Assessor, and Viewer).
   - **Project Configuration:**  
     - Configure 2 sample collaborative projects or dashboards that group these properties and display key tax assessment metrics.

2. **CORE DEMO PATHWAY OPTIMIZATION (5 hours)**
   - Refine the AI-driven tax calculation workflow:
     - Ensure that the calculation engine correctly applies local tax rates, exemptions, and other adjustment factors specific to Benton County.
     - Optimize the logic for fast, real-time tax estimates.
     - Integrate interactive elements (such as dynamic tooltips or information pop-ups) that display detailed tax calculation breakdowns.
     - Verify that all assessment outputs strictly adhere to the current standards and methodologies.

3. **VISUAL ENHANCEMENT (6 hours)**
   - Build a polished, user-friendly dashboard that:
     - Combines summary panels with detailed tax calculations.
     - Presents graphs and charts illustrating tax trends and comparisons across property types.
     - Uses the existing design system (e.g., shadcn UI and TailwindCSS) to ensure a consistent, modern look.
     - Is optimized for demo presentation with responsive design and smooth animations.

4. **PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION (4 hours)**
   - Optimize database queries and API endpoints used in the tax calculation and data display flows.
   - Implement caching for frequently accessed tax data.
   - Ensure robust error handling, particularly within the critical demo workflows.
   - Test for seamless transitions and responsiveness between different screens, especially when displaying complex tax breakdowns.

5. **DEMO MATERIALS (3 hours)**
   - Prepare a detailed, step-by-step demo script that walks through:
     - The property selection process.
     - A live demonstration of the AI-powered tax calculation, showing each component of the tax assessment.
     - How adjustments (exemptions, surcharges, rates) are applied.
   - Develop clear talking points that emphasize the business benefits—such as improved accuracy, efficiency, and streamlined operations.
   - Document all demo credentials, starting states, and any backup options (e.g., screenshots or short video clips) to ensure smooth delivery.

6. **TESTING AND DEPLOYMENT (3 hours)**
   - Conduct comprehensive tests of all demo-specific workflows, especially the core tax calculation engine and dashboard functionality.
   - Deploy the refined demo to a stable Replit environment.
   - Prepare contingency measures for potential technical issues during the live demo (e.g., backup states or static display assets).
