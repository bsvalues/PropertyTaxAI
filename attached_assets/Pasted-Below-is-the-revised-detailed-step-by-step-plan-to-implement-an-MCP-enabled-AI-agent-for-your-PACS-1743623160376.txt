Below is the revised, detailed, step‐by‐step plan to implement an MCP‐enabled AI agent for your PACS SQL Server database tailored to the Benton County Washington Assessor’s Office. In this version, we focus on property records and assessment data instead of docklands-specific information.

---

## 1. Set Up Your Development Environment

- **Choose Your Stack:**  
  Use Python 3.10+ as the primary language for MCP server development. Create a virtual environment to isolate your dependencies.

- **Install the MCP SDK:**  
  Use the official MCP Python SDK (or a package manager like `uv` as used in MCP examples) to scaffold a new MCP server project.

- **Install Database Drivers:**  
  Install the required SQL Server drivers (e.g., `pyodbc` or `pymssql`) so your MCP server can securely connect to your PACS SQL Server database that stores assessor property records.

*Example commands:*
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install mcp-agent pyodbc  # or pymssql if preferred
```

## 2. Deploy an MCP Server for the Assessor’s Property Records

- **Clone a Reference Implementation:**  
  Begin by cloning the “SQL Server Agent – Modal Context Protocol” project from MCP.so. Although originally designed for PACS, you can modify its structure to work with property records from the Benton County Washington Assessor’s database.

- **Set Up the MCP Server:**  
  Use the MCP framework to create a new server. Define endpoints (or “tools”) for common operations, for example:
  - **Schema Discovery:** A tool that queries system tables to list available assessor tables, columns, and relationships (e.g., property details, assessment values, ownership history).
  - **Query Execution:** A tool to execute dynamically generated SQL queries.
  - **Specialized Commands:** Tools such as “get_property_status” or “get_assessment_details” tailored to common assessor queries.

- **Configuration:**  
  Create a configuration file (in JSON or YAML) where you specify your SQL Server connection parameters and tool-specific settings. Ensure that sensitive details (like credentials) are securely stored.

*Example snippet (JSON):*
```json
{
  "database": {
    "server": "your-sqlserver-address",
    "database": "AssessorRecords",
    "user": "assessor_user",
    "password": "secure_password",
    "driver": "ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server"
  },
  "tools": {
    "schema_discovery": {
      "description": "Retrieves table and column information from the property records database."
    },
    "execute_query": {
      "description": "Executes a SQL query and returns property assessment results."
    },
    "get_property_status": {
      "description": "Fetches current status and assessment details for a given property."
    }
  }
}
```

## 3. Implement Core MCP Server Functions

### A. Schema Discovery

- **Purpose:**  
  Enable the MCP server to expose the schema of the property records database. This allows the LLM to generate precise SQL queries based on the actual structure of assessor data.

- **Steps:**  
  - Write a function that connects to your SQL Server.
  - Query system tables (like `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES` and `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS`) to retrieve schema details.
  - Format the output as structured JSON.

*Pseudo-code Example:*
```python
def get_schema_info(conn_str):
    conn = pyodbc.connect(conn_str)
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute("SELECT TABLE_NAME FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES WHERE TABLE_TYPE='BASE TABLE'")
    tables = [row.TABLE_NAME for row in cursor.fetchall()]
    schema = {}
    for table in tables:
        cursor.execute(f"SELECT COLUMN_NAME, DATA_TYPE FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS WHERE TABLE_NAME = '{table}'")
        columns = cursor.fetchall()
        schema[table] = [{"name": col.COLUMN_NAME, "type": col.DATA_TYPE} for col in columns]
    conn.close()
    return schema
```

### B. Query Translation and Execution

- **Purpose:**  
  Allow the AI agent to accept natural language queries (for example, “Show me all properties with assessments above $500,000”) and convert them into SQL queries that run against the assessor’s database.

- **Steps:**
  - **Natural Language Processing:**  
    Integrate an LLM (like GPT-4 or Claude) that takes a natural language query and the schema context (from schema discovery) to generate an appropriate SQL query.
    
  - **SQL Execution:**  
    Write a function that accepts a SQL query string, executes it on your assessor’s SQL Server, and returns the result set in JSON format.

*Pseudo-code Example:*
```python
def execute_sql_query(conn_str, query):
    conn = pyodbc.connect(conn_str)
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute(query)
    results = cursor.fetchall()
    columns = [column[0] for column in cursor.description]
    formatted_results = [dict(zip(columns, row)) for row in results]
    conn.close()
    return formatted_results
```

### C. Modular Design of MCP Tools

- **Dynamic Endpoint Mapping:**  
  Design your MCP server so that it accepts parameters indicating which operation to perform (e.g., “get_property_status” or a generic “execute_query”), enabling flexible and dynamic tool mapping.
  
- **Tool Registration:**  
  During startup, register each tool with its name, description, and input schema so that the MCP client can dynamically discover all available endpoints.

## 4. Integrate the LLM (MCP Client Side)

- **Embedding the MCP Client:**  
  In your AI agent application (which could run within a custom web dashboard or within an integrated system like the Benton County Assessor’s digital platform), embed the MCP client to connect to your SQL Server MCP server.

- **Providing Context to the LLM:**  
  When a user submits a natural language query (e.g., “What are the latest assessment updates for properties in Kennewick?”), the MCP client:
  - Retrieves the schema information from the schema discovery tool.
  - Sends both the query and schema context to the LLM.
  - Receives back a SQL query tailored to the assessor’s property records.
  
- **Executing and Returning Results:**  
  The MCP client forwards the generated SQL query to the execution tool, retrieves the results, and displays them in a user-friendly format.

---

## 5. Implement Security and Robustness

- **Secure Credential Management:**  
  Use environment variables, secure vaults, or encrypted configuration files to store database credentials.

- **Network Security:**  
  Ensure the SQL Server connection is encrypted using TLS, and restrict access to the MCP server through firewalls or virtual networks.

- **Input Validation:**  
  Sanitize all inputs from the LLM before executing SQL queries to prevent SQL injection. Always prefer parameterized queries.

- **Error Handling & Logging:**  
  Implement robust error handling and logging on both the MCP server and client sides for effective monitoring and debugging.

---

## 6. Prototype and Test

- **Local Testing:**  
  Run your MCP server locally and use a simple MCP client script or command-line interface to:
  - Retrieve the schema.
  - Execute sample SQL queries.
  - Validate the output format and data accuracy.

- **Iterate on Prompts:**  
  Test different natural language queries (e.g., “List all properties with an assessed value above $500,000”) and refine the prompts until the LLM-generated SQL queries are accurate.

- **Monitor Performance:**  
  Measure response times, especially for schema discovery. Consider caching schema data if needed for performance improvements.

- **User Interface Integration:**  
  Once stable, integrate the MCP client into a user-friendly interface accessible to county staff and the public, ensuring the design is responsive and intuitive.

## 7. Plan for Maintenance and Scalability

- **Documentation:**  
  Thoroughly document each MCP tool, including endpoints, input parameters, and expected outputs. This documentation will help with future updates to the assessor’s database and MCP server.

- **Version Control:**  
  Use version control (e.g., Git) to manage your MCP server code, track changes, and ensure compatibility with the AI agent application.

- **Future Enhancements:**  
  Explore advanced features like iterative query refinement for follow-up questions, agent-to-agent communication, and integration with other county data sources. Consider automated schema updates to handle changes in the assessor’s database.

## 8. Cutting-Edge Considerations for a Government Application

- **User-Centric Design:**  
  Design the user interface to be intuitive and accessible for both county staff and the public. Focus on responsive design for use on desktops and mobile devices.

- **High Availability & Load Balancing:**  
  Deploy the MCP server in a scalable cloud environment with redundancy and load balancing to manage high usage periods efficiently.

- **Compliance & Auditing:**  
  Implement strict access controls, maintain detailed audit logs, and comply with government security standards (e.g., NIST guidelines).

- **Integration with Existing Systems:**  
  Ensure seamless integration with the Benton County Washington Assessor’s current digital platforms (such as property search and public records portals) to deliver a unified user experience.

- **Real-Time Data & Notifications:**  
  Consider adding real-time notifications or dashboards to alert staff about changes in property assessments, updates, or anomalies in the data.
