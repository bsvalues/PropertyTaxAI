Below is a detailed plan that adapts the previous MCP integration strategy—originally designed for a PACS SQL Server—to create a cutting‐edge, efficient, and stable MCP‐enabled AI agent tailored to the needs of the Benton County Washington Assessor’s Office. This agent would empower county staff and citizens with natural language access to property records, assessments, and related data.

---

## 1. Define the Use Case and Objectives

- **Target Audience:**  
  County staff (assessors, auditors, planners) and the public who need rapid, accurate information on property assessments, valuation details, and related tax records.

- **Key Objectives:**  
  - **Enhanced Property Search:** Allow users to query property records using natural language (e.g., “Show me properties with a 10% valuation increase last year”).
  - **Real-Time Data Retrieval:** Provide up-to-date property valuations, ownership data, and historical changes.
  - **User-Friendly Interface:** Integrate with existing online platforms (e.g., the county’s property search website) to deliver a seamless user experience.
  - **Robust Security and Scalability:** Ensure all connections to databases and systems are secure, with minimal latency and high reliability.

---

## 2. Set Up the Development Environment

- **Choose Your Stack:**  
  Use Python as the primary language for building the MCP server.  
- **Install MCP SDK & Dependencies:**  
  Set up a Python virtual environment and install the MCP Python SDK along with necessary drivers (e.g., for SQL Server) to connect to the Assessor’s databases.

*Example commands:*
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install mcp-agent pyodbc  # or pymssql if preferred
```

- **Secure Environment Variables:**  
  Store database credentials and API keys in environment variables or a secure vault to maintain confidentiality.

---

## 3. Deploy an MCP Server for the Assessor’s Database

- **Reference Implementation:**  
  Use the “SQL Server Agent – Modal Context Protocol” project from MCP.so as a blueprint.  
  citeturn1search3

- **Define Key Tools/Endpoints:**  
  Create MCP tools tailored for the Assessor’s Office, such as:
  - **Schema Discovery:** To extract the database schema for property records.
  - **Property Query Execution:** To run SQL queries generated from natural language input.
  - **Specialized Commands:** Such as “get_property_details”, “get_tax_history”, or “find_recent_assessments”.

- **Configuration File:**  
  Create a JSON (or YAML) configuration file that includes:
  - Database connection details (server address, database name, credentials).
  - Default settings (e.g., property record tables, valuation columns).

*Example snippet (JSON):*
```json
{
  "database": {
    "server": "your-sqlserver-address",
    "database": "BentonCountyAssessor",
    "user": "assessor_user",
    "password": "assessor_password",
    "driver": "ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server"
  },
  "tools": {
    "schema_discovery": {
      "description": "Retrieves property record schema and column details."
    },
    "execute_query": {
      "description": "Executes SQL queries against the assessor database."
    },
    "get_property_details": {
      "description": "Retrieves detailed records for a given property."
    }
  }
}
```

## 4. Implement Core MCP Server Functions

### A. Schema Discovery

- **Objective:**  
  Expose the database schema (tables, columns, relationships) so the LLM can use this context to generate accurate queries.

- **Implementation:**  
  Connect to the SQL Server and query system tables such as `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES` and `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS`, then format the output as JSON.

*Pseudo-code:*
```python
def get_schema_info(conn_str):
    conn = pyodbc.connect(conn_str)
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute("SELECT TABLE_NAME FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES")
    tables = [row.TABLE_NAME for row in cursor.fetchall()]
    schema = {}
    for table in tables:
        cursor.execute(f"SELECT COLUMN_NAME, DATA_TYPE FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS WHERE TABLE_NAME = '{table}'")
        columns = [{"name": row.COLUMN_NAME, "type": row.DATA_TYPE} for row in cursor.fetchall()]
        schema[table] = columns
    conn.close()
    return schema
```

### B. Query Translation and Execution

- **Objective:**  
  Allow the AI agent to accept a natural language query, translate it into SQL (with schema context), execute it, and return results.

- **Implementation:**  
  Integrate an LLM (e.g., Claude or GPT-4) that uses the discovered schema to generate a SQL query, then execute the query and format results as JSON.

*Pseudo-code:*
```python
def execute_sql_query(conn_str, query):
    conn = pyodbc.connect(conn_str)
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute(query)
    results = cursor.fetchall()
    columns = [column[0] for column in cursor.description]
    formatted_results = [dict(zip(columns, row)) for row in results]
    conn.close()
    return formatted_results
```

### C. Modular MCP Tool Design

- **Dynamic Endpoint Mapping:**  
  Allow your server to dynamically route requests based on parameters (e.g., “get_property_details” versus a generic “execute_query”).
- **Tool Registration:**  
  Register each tool at startup with its name, description, and input schema so that the MCP client can discover available operations.

---

## 5. Integrate the LLM on the MCP Client Side

- **Embedding the Client:**  
  Embed an MCP client within your AI application (which could be a web dashboard or integration within the existing property search portal).
- **Context Provision:**  
  When a user submits a natural language query (e.g., “Show me properties with a valuation increase over 15% in the last year”), the client should:
  - Retrieve schema context via the schema discovery tool.
  - Forward the query and context to the LLM.
  - Receive the generated SQL query from the LLM.
- **Query Execution Flow:**  
  Send the SQL query to the MCP server’s execution tool, obtain the result, and display it to the user in an intuitive format (tables, graphs, etc.).

---

## 6. Ensure Security and Robustness

- **Credential Management:**  
  Use environment variables or a secure secrets manager to store credentials.
- **Encrypted Connections:**  
  Enforce TLS for all database connections and limit access using firewalls and network segmentation.
- **Input Sanitization:**  
  Validate and sanitize all LLM-generated queries to prevent SQL injection. Use parameterized queries whenever possible.
- **Error Handling and Logging:**  
  Implement comprehensive error handling to log issues and facilitate debugging.

---

## 7. Prototype, Test, and Iterate

- **Local Testing:**  
  Run your MCP server locally and use a test script to verify:
  - Schema discovery returns the correct database structure.
  - Test queries execute successfully and return the expected JSON format.
- **Prompt Iteration:**  
  Experiment with various natural language prompts to fine-tune the LLM’s SQL generation.
- **UI Integration:**  
  Once stability is achieved locally, integrate the MCP client into the existing web portal for the Benton County Assessor.
- **Performance Monitoring:**  
  Monitor response times and cache schema information if needed to improve performance.

---

## 8. Plan for Maintenance and Future Enhancements

- **Documentation:**  
  Document all endpoints, expected inputs, and outputs thoroughly.
- **Version Control:**  
  Use Git or another version control system to manage changes and ensure compatibility across updates.
- **Scalability Considerations:**  
  Plan for future enhancements like iterative query refinement and potential agent-to-agent communication as the system scales.
