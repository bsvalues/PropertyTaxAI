Based on the sources and our conversation history, the final integration of the MCP AI Agent System represents the culmination of various technological components working together to create a comprehensive system for the Benton County Assessor's Office. This integration aims to provide users with a powerful platform for querying data, analyzing information, and managing property-related records, potentially including those from the PACS database.
Here's a breakdown of the final integration as described in the sources:
•
Client-Server Architecture: The system is built upon a client-server architecture. The MCP Server acts as the backend, establishing a connection to the assessor's SQL Server database, which includes the PACS database. The server exposes "tools" or endpoints for executing database operations and retrieving specific data. The MCP Client, on the other hand, serves as the user interface and integrates with an LLM (like GPT-4 or Claude) to translate natural language queries into SQL that can be understood by the MCP server. Communication between the client and server occurs via a standardized protocol.
•
Database Connectivity and Data Access: The configuration files provide concrete details about how the system connects to the PACS database. DataConnectionsSettings.xml explicitly defines the connection string to the "PACS Database" (JCHARRISPACS) using integrated security. This file also lists pre-defined SQL queries related to property data ("Prop Data SQL", "Property", "Permits", etc.) that the AI agent can potentially leverage. The AssociatedDataModuleSettings.xml further confirms the direct interaction with the PACS database, even storing last-used query configurations. The Property_ID is identified as the key field for consistent referencing of property data.
•
LLM Integration for Natural Language Queries: A central aspect of the integration is the LLM's ability to translate natural language queries into SQL. This allows users to interact with the assessor's data, including PACS records, in a more intuitive way, without needing to know SQL. The LLM communicates with the MCP server to execute these generated queries.
•
Integration of Mapping Modules: The system seamlessly integrates various mapping modules such as Esri Map, Google Maps, and Pictometry Online. These modules allow for the spatial visualization of property data retrieved from the database, providing crucial geographical context for assessments and analysis. AvailableModulesSettings.xml lists these modules, highlighting their intended availability within the application. EsriMapModuleSettings.xml and GoogleMapModuleSettings.xml contain specific configurations for these services, including base layers and API keys.
•
Incorporation of OCR Data via ssdoc-schema2.xml: When dealing with scanned documents, the ssdoc-schema2.xml acts as a standardized format for representing OCR results, capturing not just text but also layout and spatial information. By adhering to this schema, the AI agents within the MCP system can reliably interpret the extracted text and its context from property-related documents processed from PACS. This integration enables automated data extraction and enhanced document understanding, allowing the system to leverage information contained in scanned records. Automated triggers could feed this OCR data into the MCP system for AI agent queries.
•
Real-time Communication and User Interface: The CoreSettings.xml specifies the URL for a message service, indicating the capability for real-time communication between different modules of the system. This is essential for coordinating updates and interactions, potentially including notifications related to AI agent activities or PACS data changes. MatixStateSettings.xml manages the layout and docking configurations of various modules, enabling a customizable user interface tailored to individual user preferences and workflows. AppToAppModuleSettings.xml manages the history of interactions, providing context for ongoing tasks. AssociatedDataStateSettings.xml manages user layout settings for data viewing, further enhancing personalization.
•
Automation and Advanced Use Cases: The system's design allows for automation of tasks and the implementation of advanced use cases, such as scheduled reporting, real-time alerts, integration with other county systems (like GIS and Treasurer's), and predictive analytics. The integration with PACS aligns with these possibilities, allowing the AI agent to automate data retrieval and processing from these records.
In essence, the final integration of the MCP AI Agent System involves the seamless convergence of the user-facing LLM-powered interface, the backend data access to the SQL Server and PACS database, the visual representation of data through mapping modules, and the incorporation of information from scanned documents via a standardized OCR schema. This integrated approach aims to provide the Benton County Assessor's Office with a powerful, user-friendly, and efficient platform for managing and analyzing property-related data.
